- On the page we are using supplier/category names now instead of ids
    - layout.html : removed unnecessary code
    - ProductController.java
        - some daomem-s are now instance variables, no need to define them more than once
        - all context variables are at the same place, not through functions, this way it's way more clear what we have
        - renderThePage and getCategoryImg changed according to the variables change (fewer params needed,
        return type changed, no need for webcontext anymore, renderThePage renamed)
        - addProductToShoppingCart changed, no need for httpservlet param, using int compare instead of string

- iterstat removed in multiple html loops
- product category and supplier are now under each product, selecting only that type works just like on the select menu
- added flash messages on changing the amount in shopping cart (in index as well but html refreshes each time)
- "Proceed to checkout" button is now part of the table -> will redirect to a new checkout page
- dom.js are now written in jQuery
- added error option to ajax calls -> need to handle errors on server side still
- AjaxController.java - changed Maps to HashMap from LinkedHashMap (no need to be linked)
                      - changed Map<String, String> to Map<String, Integer> -> no need to convert ints to strings anymore
- ----- Do we want Footers?? -----

TODO ------------------------------------------------------

- use less calls to SQL, no for-s etc. -> how to make joined queries into classes?
- how to use JOIN-s in SQL
- prepared statements in queries -> prevent SQL injection
