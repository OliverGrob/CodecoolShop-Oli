- On the page we are using supplier/category names now instead of ids
    - layout.html : removed unnecessary code
    - ProductController.java
        - some daomem-s are now instance variables, no need to define them more than once
        - all context variables are at the same place, not through functions, this way it's way more clear what we have
        - renderThePage and getCategoryImg changed according to the variables change (fewer params needed,
        return type changed, no need for webcontext anymore, renderThePage renamed)
        - addProductToShoppingCart changed, no need for httpservlet param, using int compare instead of string

- iterstat removed in multiple html loops
- product category and supplier are now under each product, selecting only that type works just like on the select menu
- added flash messages on changing the amount in shopping cart (in index as well but html refreshes each time)
- "Proceed to checkout" button is now part of the table -> will redirect to a new checkout page
- dom.js are now written in jQuery
- added error option to ajax calls -> need to handle errors on server side still
- AjaxController.java - changed Maps to HashMap from LinkedHashMap (no need to be linked)
                      - changed Map<String, String> to Map<String, Integer> -> no need to convert ints to strings anymore
- ----- Do we want Footers?? -----

TODO ------------------------------------------------------

 + 2 executeQuery function in JDBCController
 + rewrite all DaoJDBC-s with new query methods
 + session manager class
 - sort out every "multiple queries" (where more unnecessary query happens)
 - remove unused methods from interfaces and DaoMem-s
 - remove DaoMem-s completely
 + every object-s foreign key in SQL should appear as an object reference in their fields
 + user controller -> proper login/register
 + use Supplier and ProductCategory product ArrayList field
     (Product object creation is recursive -> Product->ProductCategory->Product->ProductCategory forever)
 - email sending where we have to
 - login with google account
 - basic testing and logging
 - final touches on checkout page (address handling, email sent screen etc.)
 - fix the theme picture size problem
 - order history page
